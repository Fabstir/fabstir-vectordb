# Fabstir Vector DB v0.2.0 - CRUD Operations Implementation

## Project Overview

Implement deletion, update, and filtering capabilities to make Fabstir Vector DB production-ready for applications requiring data lifecycle management. This addresses the critical gap in v0.1.1 where vectors cannot be deleted or updated after insertion, making it unsuitable for real-world applications where users can delete documents, GDPR "right to be forgotten", content moderation, etc.

**Target Version**: v0.2.0
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks (MVP: 6 weeks)
**Breaking Changes**: Acceptable (manifest v2 → v3)

## Architecture Summary

### New Capabilities

```
CRUD Operations (v0.2.0):
├── Deletion
│   ├── deleteVector(id)           # Delete single vector
│   ├── deleteByMetadata(filter)   # Delete by metadata criteria
│   └── vacuum()                   # Optional: Manual cleanup
├── Updates
│   └── updateMetadata(id, metadata)  # Metadata-only updates
└── Filtering
    ├── search({ filter: {...} })     # Metadata filtering
    └── Filter Language
        ├── Equals, In, Range        # Basic operators
        └── And, Or                  # Combinators
```

### Storage Changes (Manifest v3)

```
session-123/
├── manifest.json                    # Version 2 → 3
│   ├── version: 3                  # NEW
│   ├── deleted_vectors: [...]      # NEW: Tombstone list
│   ├── schema: {...}               # NEW: Optional schema definition
│   └── (existing v2 fields)
└── (chunks remain unchanged)
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Soft Deletion**: Mark as deleted, filter from results, physically remove on save
- **IVF Deletion**: Copy HNSW pattern (`mark_deleted()`, `vacuum()`)
- **Metadata Updates**: In-memory HashMap only (no vector/index changes)
- **Post-Filtering**: Filter after vector search (no indexed metadata)
- **Lazy Deletion**: Defer chunk rewriting until next `saveToS5()`

#### 3.2 Save/Load Integration (Day 11) ✅ COMPLETE

**TDD Approach**: Verification phase - tests already exist

- [x] **Verification**: Metadata persistence already fully implemented

  - [x] **Node.js Binding Implementation** (`bindings/node/src/session.rs`):

    - Equals: Extracts field via nested path, compares values, special array contains logic
    - In: Checks if field value is in values list
    - Range: Validates numeric field is within [min, max] (inclusive)
    - And: All sub-filters must match (empty = true, vacuous truth)
    - Or: At least one sub-filter must match (empty = false)
  - [x] Implemented `get_field(metadata: &JsonValue, path: &str) -> Option<&JsonValue>`
    - Supports nested paths with dot notation: "user.id" → metadata["user"]["id"]
    - Traverses arbitrary depth: "data.location.city"
    - Returns None for missing paths
  - [x] Defined `FilterError` enum with 3 variants:
    - `InvalidSyntax(String)` - Malformed filter structure
    - `UnsupportedOperator(String)` - Unknown operator like `$invalid`
    - `TypeMismatch { expected, actual }` - Type incompatibility

- [x] **Modified**: `src/core/mod.rs`
  - [x] Added `pub mod metadata_filter;`
  - [x] Exported `MetadataFilter`, `FilterError`, `get_field`

**Bounded Autonomy**: 617 lines for metadata_filter.rs (within reasonable scope for filter language)

**Test Results**: ✅ **14/14 tests passing** (100% success rate)

#### 4.2 Search Integration (Day 16-18) ✅ COMPLETE

**TDD Approach**: Write integration tests for filtered search

- [x] **Test File**: `tests/integration/search_filter_tests.rs` (created, 430 lines)

  - [x] Test search with Equals filter
  - [x] Test search with In filter
  - [x] Test search with Range filter
  - [x] Test search with And combinator
  - [x] Test search with Or combinator
  - [x] Test search with no matches (returns empty)
  - [x] Test search with k_oversample (verifies top-k truncation)
  - [x] Test search no filter (backward compatibility)
  - [x] Test filter with array fields
  - [x] Test complex filter combinations
  - [x] Test filter preserves ranking order

- [x] **Example**: `examples/test_search_filter.rs` (created, 170 lines)
  - Demonstrates all filter types with real output
  - Validates filtered search functionality end-to-end
  - All 5 test scenarios passing

- [x] **Implementation**: `src/hybrid/core.rs` (added 61 lines, lines 463-524)

  - [x] Added `search_with_filter()` method:
    - Signature: `pub async fn search_with_filter(&self, query: &[f32], k: usize, filter: Option<&MetadataFilter>, metadata_map: &HashMap<String, serde_json::Value>) -> Result<Vec<SearchResult>, HybridError>`
    - If filter is None, delegates to regular `search()` (backward compatibility)
    - If filter is Some, implements k-oversampling strategy:
      - Calculates k_oversample = k * 3 (3x multiplier)
      - Runs vector search with k_oversample candidates
      - Filters results by metadata using `filter.matches(metadata)`
      - Truncates to k results (already sorted by distance)
      - Returns filtered and ranked results
    - Preserves distance-based ranking after filtering

**Bounded Autonomy**: 61 lines in core.rs (efficient implementation, no separate file needed)

**Test Results**: ✅ **All 5 example scenarios passing** (100% functional validation)

```
Test 1: Equals filter (category = 'technology')
  ✅ Results: 3 vectors (vec-0, vec-1, vec-3)

Test 2: Range filter (views >= 1000)
  ✅ Results: 3 vectors (vec-0, vec-2, vec-3)

Test 3: AND combinator (technology + published)
  ✅ Results: 2 vectors (vec-0, vec-3)

Test 4: Array field matching (tags contains 'ai')
  ✅ Results: 2 vectors (vec-0, vec-3)

Test 5: No filter (backward compatibility)
  ✅ Results: 4 vectors (all)
```

**Implementation Features**:
- K-oversampling strategy ensures sufficient candidates after filtering
- Backward compatible with existing search API
- Preserves distance-based ranking
- Efficient post-filtering (no index modifications required)
- Works with both HNSW and IVF indices transparently

## Success Criteria

**Functional Requirements (MVP - Must Have)**:

- [ ] `deleteVector(id)` removes vectors from index and search results
- [ ] `deleteByMetadata(filter)` removes matching vectors
- [ ] `updateMetadata(id, metadata)` updates metadata without re-indexing
- [ ] `search(query, k, { filter })` filters results by metadata
- [ ] Deleted vectors persist across save/load cycles
- [ ] Filter language supports Equals, In, Range, And, Or
- [ ] Manifest v3 includes deleted_vectors list
- [ ] Backward compatible: v0.2.0 loads v0.1.1 CIDs (forward-only)

**Functional Requirements (Optional - Nice to Have)**:

- [ ] Schema validation on insert/update
- [ ] `vacuum()` API for manual cleanup
- [ ] Vacuum stats in `getStats()`

**Code Quality**:

- [ ] All tests pass (unit + integration + E2E)
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for new code
- [ ] All files within max line limits
- [ ] No clippy warnings
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

**Performance Requirements**:

- [ ] Deletion overhead: <5% impact on search latency
- [ ] Post-filtering: <10ms overhead for 1000 candidates → 10 results
- [ ] Metadata updates: <1ms per update
- [ ] Vacuum: <100ms for 1000 deletions

## Risk Mitigation

**Complexity Risk**:

- **Mitigation**: Strict TDD with bounded autonomy (max line counts per file)
- **Mitigation**: Small sub-phases (<2 days each)
- **Mitigation**: Copy proven patterns (HNSW deletion → IVF deletion)

**Performance Risk**:

- **Mitigation**: Post-filtering approach (no index changes required)
- **Mitigation**: k_oversample strategy to maintain result quality
- **Mitigation**: Benchmark at Phase 5 before finalizing

**Compatibility Risk**:

- **Mitigation**: Manifest version bump (v2 → v3)
- **Mitigation**: Forward-only compatibility (v0.2.0 reads v0.1.1, not vice versa)
- **Mitigation**: Migration guide for users

**Architecture Risk**:

- **Mitigation**: Metadata remains separate from indices (no storage redesign)
- **Mitigation**: Lazy deletion (defer chunk rewriting until save)
- **Mitigation**: Soft deletion pattern proven in HNSW

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Decision Log

**2025-01-XX**: Chose soft deletion over hard deletion:

- Rationale: Hard deletion requires chunk rewriting (expensive, complex)
- Approach: Mark as deleted, filter from results, physically remove on save
- Trade-off: Deleted vectors consume storage until next save
- Mitigation: Optional `vacuum()` API for manual cleanup

**2025-01-XX**: Chose post-filtering over indexed metadata:

- Rationale: Indexed metadata requires storage redesign (out of scope for v0.2.0)
- Approach: Filter after vector search using k_oversample strategy
- Trade-off: Cannot pre-filter before vector search (may load unnecessary chunks)
- Mitigation: k_oversample = k × 3 (configurable) to maintain result quality

**2025-01-XX**: Chose metadata-only updates (no vector updates):

- Rationale: Vector updates require HNSW graph repair (complex, risky)
- Approach: Update metadata HashMap only (no index changes)
- Trade-off: Cannot update vector embeddings after insertion
- Future: Vector updates deferred to v0.3.0

**2025-01-XX**: Chose manifest v2 → v3 (breaking change):

- Rationale: Need to store deleted_vectors list for persistence
- Approach: Bump version, add new fields, provide migration guide
- Trade-off: v0.1.1 cannot read v0.2.0 CIDs
- Mitigation: Forward-only compatibility acceptable for early versions

### Open Questions

- [ ] Should k_oversample multiplier be configurable? (default: 3)

  - Pro: More control for advanced users
  - Con: Additional complexity

- [ ] Should vacuum be automatic or manual?

  - Option A: Automatic before every save (simpler, slower saves)
  - Option B: Manual API (faster saves, user must remember)
  - Decision: Manual API (MVP), explore auto-vacuum in v0.3.0

- [ ] Should we add updateVector() in v0.2.0? (update embeddings, not just metadata)
  - Pro: Complete CRUD operations
  - Con: Requires HNSW graph repair (high complexity, high risk)
  - Decision: Defer to v0.3.0

### Issues Tracker

_Track blockers and resolutions here_

---

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 5 days (IVF soft deletion)
- **Phase 2**: 5 days (Node.js deletion API)
- **Phase 3**: 2-3 days (Metadata updates)
- **Phase 4**: 8-10 days (Metadata filtering)
- **Phase 5**: 5 days (Testing & documentation)
- **Phase 6**: 8-10 days (Optional polish)

**MVP Total (Phases 1-5)**: 25-28 days (~5-6 weeks)
**Full Total (Phases 1-6)**: 33-38 days (~7-8 weeks)

**Buffer**: Add 20% for unexpected issues → **6-8 weeks total**

**Recommended Approach**: Ship MVP (Phases 1-5) first, iterate on polish (Phase 6) in v0.2.1 based on user feedback.
