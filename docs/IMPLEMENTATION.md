- [x] **8.4.1 Environment Configuration** ‚úÖ

  - [x] Add S5_MODE environment variable (mock/real)
  - [x] Configure S5_PORTAL_URL for custom portals
  - [x] Handle S5_SEED_PHRASE via environment
  - [x] Add connection timeout settings
  - [x] Add seed phrase validation (BIP39)
  - [x] Implement secure seed phrase loading from files
  - [x] Add comprehensive configuration validation

- [x] **8.4.2 Runtime Mode Switching** ‚úÖ
  - [x] Create consistent API regardless of mode
  - [x] Implement mode detection on startup
  - [x] Add mode status to REST API health endpoint
  - [x] Add configuration summary logging on startup
  - [ ] Document mode-specific behaviours (external docs needed)

**Results**: All functionality implemented. 12 tests passing. Only external documentation remains.

### 8.5 Docker & Networking ‚è≥ TODO

- [ ] **8.5.1 Container Networking**

  - [x] Configure Docker networking for host access
  - [x] Add container name resolution
  - [ ] Update main docker-compose.yml with profiles
  - [ ] Test cross-container communication thoroughly
  - [ ] Add docker-compose override examples

- [ ] **8.5.2 Development Workflow**
  - [ ] Create scripts for starting mock/real servers
  - [ ] Add mode validation on startup
  - [ ] Provide clear setup instructions
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
  - [ ] Create development environment setup script

### 8.6 Integration Testing & Validation ‚è≥ TODO

- [ ] **8.6.1 Comprehensive Test Suite**

  - [ ] Create mode-agnostic test helpers
  - [ ] Implement parallel test execution
  - [ ] Add performance comparison (mock vs real)
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and edge cases
  - [ ] Add integration tests for full stack

- [ ] **8.6.2 Migration Path**
  - [ ] Create migration tool from mock to real storage
  - [ ] Test data integrity during migration
  - [ ] Document migration procedures
  - [ ] Add rollback capabilities
  - [ ] Create backup/restore utilities

### Success Criteria

- [x] All existing tests pass with Enhanced s5.js integration
- [x] Mock mode provides <10ms latency for development
- [ ] Real S5 portal connection handles 1000+ QPS
- [x] Seamless mode switching without code changes
- [ ] Clear documentation for both modes
- [x] No regression in vector database functionality

### Technical Decisions

1. **Why Adapter Pattern**: Allows runtime mode selection without changing client code
2. **Mock Server First**: Enables rapid development without S5 network dependency
3. **Path-Based API**: Matches Enhanced s5.js fs API for consistency
4. **Seed Phrase Management**: Generated if not provided, stored securely

### Dependencies

- Enhanced s5.js library (latest version with path-based API)
- Docker networking configuration for host access
- S5 portal account (for real mode testing)

### Risks & Mitigations

1. **Risk**: WASM compatibility issues with s5.js

   - **Mitigation**: Use s5.js via Node.js API server if needed

2. **Risk**: Network latency in real mode affecting performance

   - **Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching and batch operations

3. **Risk**: Mock server availability during development
   - **Mitigation**: Auto-detect and provide clear setup instructions

### Estimated Timeline

- Week 1: Enhanced s5.js integration and adapter pattern
- Week 2: Mock server integration and testing
- Week 3: Real S5 portal integration and testing
- Week 4: Polish, documentation, and migration tools
